= Définitions des données Japon

Dans les données accessibles sur le portail suivant
https://www.e-stat.go.jp/en/regional-statistics/ssdsview/prefectures, il est
possible de voir le nombre de _in-migrant from other prefectures (all
nationalities)_ et de _out-migrant to other prefectures (all nationalities)_
pour chacune des préfectures. 

Voici la définition de chacune de ces variables:
  - The number of in-migrants refers to the "number of in-migrants" in the Basic
    Resident Register Population Movement Report (hereinafter referred to as the
    "Report"), which refers to the number of people who moved from other
    prefectures or municipalities to the area of the prefecture or
    municipality concerned and changed their address.
  - The number of out-migrants refers to the "number of out-migrants" in the
    Report, which refers to the number of people who moved to another
    prefecture or municipality across the border of the prefecture or municipality
    concerned. However, this number is calculated by the Statistics Bureau based on
    the previous address of the in-migrants (by prefecture and municipality), and
    does not necessarily match the number of people who have been issued a
    moving-out certificate as stipulated in Article 23 of the Enforcement Order of
    the Basic Resident Register Act ( 　hereinafter referred to as the "Enforcement
    Order"). The number of in-migrants and out-migrants includes both Japanese and
    foreigners. The number of in-migrants and out-migrants (by gender) is collected
    for each year.
