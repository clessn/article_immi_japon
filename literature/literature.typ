Uses a multilevel model to estimate to test multiple hypotheses regarding
economic threat, cultural threat, contact, and salience of change.

*Hypotheses and findings*

H1: Cultural threat is stronger than economic threat in Japan.

H2: Superficial contact is likely to reduce anti-immigrant sentiment in Japan.

H3: Foreign population growth rates have a stronger effect
on public opinion overall foreign population size. 

The _cultural threat_ seems to drive opinion on immigration more than any other factor.
At the national level, _areas with larger existing foreign populations_ are more 
favorable to additional increases in immigration. _Superficial contact_ seems
to have at least some positive associations with immigration in Japan. 

*Data*

He uses the JGSS-2010 data (*Serious limitation for the sustainability of his
conclusions!*), with a total of 1 630 respondents over the 47 prefectures. He also
adds the data from the Satistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications of Japan to account for the registered 
foreign population by prefecture, as well as breakdowns of nationality
and immigrant population size by year. 

*Methods*

Uses a _multilevel logistic regression_, because he argues that individual
demographics and prefecture-level of foreign population have an influence on
public perception in Japan. One potential issue with this method is the small
amount of respondents in some prefecture.

About the number of respondents per prefecture, the multilevel models seems to 
be estiamted with a few number of observations per category for a random slopes.
For a random slopes and coefficient, it needs a little bit more of observations,
but yet does not require to have like 200-300 observations per category.
